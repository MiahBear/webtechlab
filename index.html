<h2> Asin Rd. Barangay (Baguio City) </h2>
<h3> Histrorical Overview </h3>
<p>In the early 1900's the area now known as Bcbacan was part of the Municipality of Tuba, 
under the so-called Municipal President, now knonw as Municipal Mayor. Back then, this area  
was thickly forested and teeming with birds,  some species of deer, squirels, insects, and 
other forms of wildlife. Noteworthy of the numerous frogs and toads, which during the rainy 
days made a cacaphony of sounds that one would never forget when one hears it.
This accourding to the legend was the basis of the name of the place bacbacan, 
or the place of frogs, as the Igorot term of frog <b>"Bacbac"</b></p>

<h3> State of Human Resources </h3>

<p>The population of Asin Road barangay consists of those employed as carpenters, woodcarvers, 
drivers, and others. We have small scale farmers who hire few workers for preparation stage 
and harvest. For woodcarvers, they hire workers on a daily basis and according to what they 
finished. The Barangay Captain will upon request provide the number of those employed broker down 
by type of employment as well as the number of unemployed inhabitants and those underemployed. </p>
